# plainyr-rev-modern (v0.2.3)

A modernized version of the `plainyr` BibTeX style, featuring **reverse chronological ordering** (newest to oldest) and enhanced DOI support.

## Key Features
* **Reverse Chronological Order**: Automatically sorts your bibliography starting from the most recent year.
* **Robust DOI Support**: Perfect handling of special characters (like underscores `_`) in DOI strings.
* **Clickable Links**: Generates active links via the `https://doi.org/` resolver.

## ⚠️ Mandatory Requirement
To ensure DOIs and underscores are rendered correctly, you **must** include the `hyperref` package in your LaTeX preamble:

```latex
\usepackage{hyperref}
```

## Usage
1. Download `plainyr-rev-modern.bst` and place it in your project folder.
2. In your `.tex` file, set the style:

```latex
\bibliographystyle{plainyr-rev-modern}
\bibliography{your-bib-file}
```
